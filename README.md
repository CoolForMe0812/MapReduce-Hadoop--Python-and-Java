This project is aimed to apply the mapreduce algorithm to produce the counts of each word occurring from the Kaggle Covid 19â€™s dataset- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/charlieharper/spatial-data-for-cord19-covid19-ordc. 

Steps for Data Preprocessing, Data Analysis and Data Visualization: 
1. The dataset from this variable was downloaded from its website and processed using SAS Enterprise Guide.
2. MapReduce Word Count is then further tested and implemented in the VMware workstation player to obtain the word count. 
3. Then, word count is analyzed and visualized through opinion mining by applying sentiment analysis using graph theory approach to analyze the sentiment polarity and distribution of frequent words, thus identifying the most relatable words from the dataset allowing us to study the opinions of these articles based on keyword relationships.
